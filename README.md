# Natural-Number-Calculator
Contains the code for my Natural Number Calculator app on Android built in Android Studio.

The app functionality is:
  * Add natural numbers
  * Subtract natural numbers
  * Display the number created from the selected operation
  
Note: The natural number component files have been removed to avoid any potential academic misconduct issues with The Ohio State University, as they are based off of assignments given during my time there.  Please email dangreer97@gmail.com if you wish to view these files.
